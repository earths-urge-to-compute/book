# Earth's Urge to Compute

Long, long ago, gravity pulled together a clump of dust and debris to form the Earth. 
As material accreted, it became hot enough to melt both metals and silicates.
It experienced nearly a billion years of intense vulcanism and meteorite impacts.

Around 4.5 billion years after this clump of mass came together, it sent probes to
investigate nearby planets. These probes contained intricate sensors, such as video 
cameras and a wide range of scientific instruments. They used radio waves to send hundreds
of terabytes of data back to the Earth. They were controlled partly through radio signals
sent from Earth and partly by onboard computers.

How did this happen? Why did this happen? When we consider such questions, we usually go
straight to specific and complex mechanisms like life, evolution, and the human species.
But let's try a simpler and more direct starting point: the Earth learned to think. It
developed curiosity. It developed a desire to learn more about its solar neighborhood.
It developed the capability to send probes to other planets. And then it did.

Throughout human history, every time we develop a new paradigm for understanding the reality
we perceive around us, we feel as though that must be the true, fundamental explanation.
We spend decades or centuries reinterpreting everything around us through that paradigm.
When later generations look back on this, it seems painfully naive. We eventually understand
that the heavenly bodies are not embedded in eternally rotating crystal spheres, that a sperm
does not contain a tiny person, and that classical physics is just an approximation.
Even though the conclusions we reach from each new scientific revolution will eventually
be embarrassing, this process of perpetual reinterpretation is essential to how we learn.

It is time to take a fresh look at the Earth's formation, development, and ultimately 
behavior through the lens of computation. Let's embrace the evident truth that the
Earth learned to think, developed curiosity and desire, and learned to act on its
desires. Let's at first hold ourselves back from the details where we normally swim -- 
ideas like cells, evolution, and neurons -- and ask what we can observe, measure,
infer, and calculate about the overall process.
