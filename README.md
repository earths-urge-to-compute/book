# Earth's Urge to Compute

This is an "open source" collaborative project to write a book. We use 
scare quotes around "open source" because this is a book, not software,
but it is run just like an open source software project.

## Reading the Book

Start at [src/introduction.md](./src/introduction.md).
This will get fancier over time.

## Contributing Content

All material in this repo is Copyright 2018 or later by Dean Thompson, 
available for distribution and reuse as defined in [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt).

The initial author, Dean Thompson, will welcome contributions once some initial 
scaffolding is in place to set a direction. That said, Dean intends to gently
assert creative control for the life of the project, to maintain a consistent
vision and to get a cohesive result.

Content contributors will be able to propose changes to the book's 
Markdown files (in the `src` directory) through GitHub's user interface.

All content will be incorporated into the same Creative Commons license.
Dean hasn't yet sorted out that process.

## Building the Book

See [BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md).
